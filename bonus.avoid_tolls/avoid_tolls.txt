To tests the navigation with toll and highway restrictions we built a map named "israel.json" and ran the following search:
- origin point is Junction "J1026"
- destination point is Junction "J1020"

There are four ways leaving J1026, three of them are highways and toll roads and only one of them is not.
The fourth way leads to the slowest route of all possible routes (but with the shortest distance).
The route that starts with this non-toll and non-highway way must run through 
run through Way "W2045", and no other route does.

 The expected output of the test is that the shortestTimeRoute would be different
with and without restrictions of "highway"/"toll" and this is what the test checks.
